## Cyclistic Case Study Report

### ***Ask***
Ever since its launch in 2016, Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company, has grown to over 5,824 bicycles in a network of over 692 stations across the state of Chicago. So far, the company has relied on using various flexible pricing plans to attract customers: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. The company wants to increase its future growth by proposing the idea of converting existing casual riders to annual members, since annual memberships are deemed much more profitable for the company by the financial analytics team. 

As part of the Cyclistics analytics marketing team, my job will be to figure out how annual and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently and use those insights to design a strategy to encourage casual riders to become annual members.

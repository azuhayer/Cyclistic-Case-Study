## Cyclistic Case Study Report

### ***Ask***
Ever since its launch in 2016, Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company, has grown to over 5,824 bicycles in a network of over 692 stations across the state of Chicago. So far, the company has relied on using various flexible pricing plans to attract customers: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. The company wants to increase its future growth by proposing the idea of converting existing casual riders to annual members, since annual memberships are deemed much more profitable for the company by the financial analytics team. 

As part of the Cyclistics analytics marketing team, my job will be to figure out how annual and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently and use those insights to design a strategy to encourage casual riders to become annual members. 

### ***Prepare***
The data that I will be utilizing to help the company come to a business decision are the ```Divvy_Trips_2019_Q1.csv``` and ```Divvy_Trips_2020_Q1.csv``` files. Both of these files have been made available through the Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). These datasets gives us information regarding the different types of customers and how they use Cyclistic bikes. With the help of various data analysis tools these public datasets will allow me to explore how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. 

The datasets contain detailed information about ride start and end times, stations, user types, and trip durationsâ€”allowing for comparison between annual members and casual riders. Both files are stored in CSV (comma-separated values) format, making them suitable for analysis using Python and libraries such as pandas and NumPy. These tools will allow me to manipulate and explore the data effectively to identify usage trends between the two customer groups.
